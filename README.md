# Parking-Management-System
This project aims to create a program for vehicle administration in a parking lot. It should perform commands like adding, removing, displaying, and browsing vehicles, as well as calculating parking fees. The program utilizes concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and basic algorithms. It includes classes such as "Vehicle" with derived classes "Car" and "Motorbike", and a separate "Manager" class for operations.

If someone want to develop and apply this program in real-life scenarios, one potential direction suggested is combinning it with NFC devices for self-check-in and self-check-out.
